<h1>The Effectiveness and Fairness of Stop and Search as a Method of Crime Reduction</h1>
<div class='text_no_graph'>
  <p>
    'Stop and search' refers to the police's power to stop people either on foot or in a
    vehicle, search their outer clothing and luggage and gather basic personal information.
    There are two types of stop and search, suspicion-based (known as section 1) and suspicion-less (known as section
    60).
    The former makes up the vast majority of stop and searches and forms the popular perception of 'stop and search'.
  </p>
  <p>
    Proponents of stop and search claim it reduces crime by both finding articles of crime, mainly drugs and weapons,
    but also by acting as a deterrent to potential criminals. They also say the associated police presence reassures the
    public and makes them feel safer. Opponents of the policy claim it has little effect on crime and unfairly targets
    ethnic minority and socioeconomically disadvantaged groups, compromising public trust in the police.
  </p>
  <p>
    This story aims to assess whether stop and search is effective in reducing violent and drug-related crime.
    It will also consider how different groups are targeted by stop and search and what impact it has on their
    relationship with the police.
  </p>

    <div>
      <h3>Historic Trends in Stop and Search</h3>
      <p> The total number of stop and searches (referred to here as 'stops') in England and Wales increased
        consistently throughout the 2000s.
        Its usage then began to decline at the turn of the decade, many thought irreversibly.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, the number of stops has increased in recent years, leading to renewed discussion about their
        effectiveness.
      </p>

    </div>

    <div>
      <h3>Operation Blunt 2</h3>
      <p>
        In the spring of 2008, with nationwide stops at an all-time high, the Metropolitan police launched operation
        Blunt 2.
        The new mayor of London, Boris Johnson, called it a <em>"sustained, visible, long-term operation".</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        There was a sharp increase in the number of stops, as many as a threefold increase in some boroughs.
        This period can therefore be used to assess the impact on crime both during and after the operation.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h3>Effect on Violent Crime</h3>
      <p>
        Whilst there was a decrease in possession of offensive weapons during the operation, this trend was already in
        motion beforehand and continued afterwards.
        It therefore appears that the operation had little impact in this regard.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div>
      <p>
        There was also little change to the amount of violent crime occuring in the city.
        The decreasing trend of robberies and violent assaults was largely undisturbed...
      </p>
    </div>

    <div>
      <p>
        ...and there was little impact on the amount of murders and manslaughters.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h3>Effect on Drug-related crime</h3>
      <p>
        Counter-intuitively, the operation saw a sustained trend reversal in the number of arrests for possession of
        drugs. It
        is
        difficult to tell whether this was because
        the stops were ineffective compared to previously used measures or because they acted as a detterent.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div>
      <p>
        It is telling that even while arrests for drug possession were decreasing, arrests for drug trafficking offences
        stayed largely constant. This indicates that the wider market for drugs was likely undisturbed by increased stop
        and search measures.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div> </div>

  </div>

</div>

<div class='text_no_graph'>
  <p>
    In the time since operation Blunt 2 concluded, Boris Johnson has ascended the ranks of British politics to become
    prime minister.
    In a 2018 ITV interview he said of the operation: <em>"We took tens of thousands of knives off the streets. It was
      controversial, people said it was unfair, but, by God, it worked.‚Äù</em>
    Despite these claims, the home office's own report into the effectiveness of operation Blunt 2 concluded that
    <em>"Overall, analysis shows that there was no discernible crime-reducing effects from a
      large surge in stop and search activity at the borough level during the operation"</em> [5].
    Furthermore, Johnson's repeated claim that 11,000 knives were taken off the streets using stop and search has been
    questioned by fact-checkers, with the true number thought to be less than half that [4].
  </p>
  <p>
    The 'unfairness' of stop and search the prime minister was alluding to in 2018 is the focus of the next section.
    Many people claim that stop and search measures disproportionately target members of certain ethnic minority groups,
    especially black people. Police efforts also tend to be focussed in areas of higher deprivation, and many claim this
    fuels a downward spiral of poor community-police relations.

      <h3>Disproportionality in Stop and Search by Ethnicity</h3>
      <p> At first glance, it appears white people are by far those most frequently stopped by police.</p>
    </div>

    <div style=height:600px;>
      <p>
        However, once poplulation is adjusted for, it is clear that black people make up roughly half of all those
        stopped, with white people being targeted the least.
      </p>
      <p>
        Depending on the exact figures used, research consistently shows that black people are at least 4 times more
        likely to be stopped by police in London, despite the fact that searches of black people are <em>less</em>
        likely to detect crime [2]. For young black males, the numbers are even more shocking. Research from
        University College London has shown that they were stopped 19 times as often as the wider population in
        the third quarter of 2020 [1].

    <div>
      <h3> Geographical Disproportionality in Stop and Search </h3>
      <p>
        Data on the location of every stop and search from 2020 can be combined with index of multiple (IMD) scores to
        study their relationship. The large coverage of neutral colours (white, grey, black) on the
        map indicates that in most boroughs, the number of stops closely relates to the level of deprivation. In the
        third quarter of this period, stops for weapons in the most deprived half of neighbourhoods accounted for 80% of
        all stops [1].
      </p>
      <p>
        Take some time exploring the map, bearing in mind that the average number of stops per 1000 people is 24.6, and
        the average IMD score is 21.3. Consider why some boroughs, especially in south-central London, might be
        bordering boroughs with a vastly different relationship between stops and deprivation.

      <h3>Public Opinion of Stop and Search</h3>
      <p>
        A survey by the Indepedent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) aimed to assess public opinion of the police on a
        variety of matters, including stop and search [6]. Although the majority of people view stop and search as a
        necessary procedure, less than half think it is being applied correctly.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div>
      <p>
        Of those people who think it is not applied correctly, the most common reason is that not all groups of people
        are treated the equally.
        Although the study does not specify which groups this refers to, it is worth investigating the opinions of
        people
        belonging to different ethnic groups,
        given the previously described disproportionality that exists between them.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div>
      <p>
        There is a clear distinction between how white people and members of ethnic minority groups feel about stop and
        search.
        White people are about 1.5 times more likely to approve of stop and search as it is currently used.
      </p>
    </div>

  <div id='sections'>
    <div>
      <h3> Attitudes of Ethnic Minority Groups Towards the Police </h3>
      <p>
        The disparities regarding opinions on stop and search are reflected in people's opinions of the police more
        generally.
        Close to a quarter (23%) of BAME respondents don't think the police respond in a fair and proportionate way -
        this percentage is higher than that of the general public (17%).
      </p>
    </div>

    <div>
      <p>
        A different survey, specifically on the human rights of the black community found that the vast majority (85%)
        are not confident that they would be treated the same as a white person by the police [3].
      </p>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h3>Personal accounts of interactions with the police.</h3>
      <p>
        The causes and indicators of crime are complex, and it is difficult to draw conclusions about whether stop and
        search does more harm than good.
        However, reading these accounts may give you a different perspective on those who are distrusting of police.
        Perhaps you've had interactions with the police before. How do you think a negative experience like this would
        impact your own opinion of the police?
      </p>

  <p>
    <b>A Note on Terminology:</b> Descriptors of broad ethnic groups are taken from the corresponding data sources for
    integrity, they may therefore not be used consistently throughout. It should also be noted that some of these terms,
    most notably 'BAME' are no longer in common use.
